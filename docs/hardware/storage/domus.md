# Domus

UPPMAX has many [storage systems](../../cluster_guides/uppmax_storage_system.md).
This page describes the Domus storage system.

Domus is about to be decomissioned.

- Domus hosted the home directories, now at Gorilla.
- Still some common system directories, e.g. the
software catalogue is hosted here.

- The system is a NetApp totalling 100 TB on 96 SAS 10K
disks, supports snapshots, and has off-site backup.
