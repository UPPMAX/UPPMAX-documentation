# Crex

Rackham and Snowy's storage system is a DDN (DataDirect Networks) EXAScaler

24 300GB SAS drives for metadata storage. The total volume is 6 PB, with 1 PB
reserved for SciLifeLab, 4.5 PB reserved for SNIC projects, and 0.5 PB for
UPPMAX use. The filesystem is Lustre, a highly scalable filesystem common in
HPC.
