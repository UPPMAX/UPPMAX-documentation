    This 1-day course helps you get started with Python,
    by working through an online and free book.
    We make use of HPC clusters
    to write and run Python code.
    The pace of this highly interactive course
    is set by the majority of learners,
    ensuring that any complete beginner
    has enough time for exercises.
    At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with the basics
    of Python and feel familiar to a book on Python to help you on your next steps.

This 1-day course helps you get started with Python,
by working through an online and free book.
We make use of the UPPMAX HPC cluster
to write and run Python code,
but you may use a different machine if you prefer.
The pace of this highly interactive course
is set by the majority of learners,
ensuring that any complete beginner
has enough time for exercises.
At the end of the day, you should feel comfortable with the basics
of Python and feel familiar to a book on Python to help you on your next steps.

You will:

- Feel comfortable with learning Python
- Feel comfortable using an online and free book on Python
- Write Python code on an HPC cluster
- Run Python scripts on an HPC cluster

Practical matters:

- Registration form: [here](https://forms.gle/kzazFVBBo6HPHfub9)
- When: Tuesday March 4th 2025, 9:00-16:00 ([course schedule](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/overviews/schedule/))
- Where: Online via Zoom. Zoom room and password will be mailed :+1:
- [Course material](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/)
- [Earlier evaluations of the course](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/evaluations/)

Before the course, you must have done these *four* things:

- Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form at [here](https://forms.gle/kzazFVBBo6HPHfub9)

- Prerequisite 2/4: A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    When you can login at [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/).

    It should look similar to this:

    ![A user that logged into SUPR](./img/supr_logged_in.png)

???- question "How to get this?"

    Register at [https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/).

???- question "What if I have a problem here?"

    Contact `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se`

- Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    This depends on the HPC cluster you are using.
    For UPPMAX's Rackham, it look similar to this:

    ![Logged into Rackham](./img/rackham_logged_in.png)

???- question "Is it OK if I can login using other methods?"

    Probably: yes

    - Using a website: yes
    - Using a local ThinLinc client: yes

???- question "How to get this?"

    Follow the instructions of your favorite HPC center
    or [the UPPMAX instruction](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/getting_started/login_rackham_console_password/)

???- question "What if I have a problem here?"

    Contact `richel.bilderbeek@uppmax.uu.se`

- Prerequisite 4/4: have a good Zoom setup

???- question "How can I check if I have this?"

    - You are in a room where you can talk
    - You talk into a (standalone or headset) microphone
    - Others can clearly hear you when you talk
    - Others can see you
    - You can hear others clearly when they talk

???- question "How to get this?"

    - Find/schedule/book a room where you can talk
    - Buy a simple headset

???- question "What if I don't have this? Is that OK?"

    No.

    You will feel left out, as the course in highly interactive.
    It would be weird to the other learners.

???- question "What if I have social anxiety?"

    Sorry to hear that. In this course, it is OK to give a wrong
    answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
    learner had to say on this:

    > As a learner, you do not want to be berated when giving an answer.
    > Richel tries to gently deal with a wrong answer and he does this great
    >
    > A learner from this course ([source](https://uppmax.github.io/uppmax_intro_python/evaluations/2024_01/))

    You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
    The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
    for all exercises.
    Do fill in the evaluation when you leave early :-)
