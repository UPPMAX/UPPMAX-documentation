# Programming formalisms

The goal of this highly-interactive 5-day course is to be able to develop
academic software that you can trust to be 'good enough'.
We assume you have written code 'that (sometimes) just works'.

The course follows a formal development process from start to finish,
with a selection of topics and best practices we think are most important,
with the goal of developing academic software that is actually good enough.
The course aims to strengthen the understanding of more advanced programming
concepts, ability to produce more reusable scripts through modular
programming and to enable a better understanding of how to evaluate
a script or programs performance.

We will cover:

- an introduction to Algorithms and Data structures
- programming Paradigms especially structured and object oriented programming
- an overview of other paradigms like functional programming.
- modular development and (code) reusability, testing and optimisation.

We will cover theory with bridging practical examples and applications to
enhance the theoretical understanding of the principles.
