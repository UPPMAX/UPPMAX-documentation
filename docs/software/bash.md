# Bash

Bash is the default Unix shell,
a command-line interpreter and script host that provides
a traditional user interface for the linux operating system at UPPMAX.
Users direct the operation of the computer by entering command input as text
for a command line interpreter to execute or by creating
text scripts of one or more such commands.

## Special Bash files

- `.bash_profile`: is run whenever you login or when you start a login
  shell (as in starting a job in the queue).
- `.bashrc`: is run when an interactive shell that is not a login shell
  is started, or if it is called from the `.bash_profile`
  (as it is in the default configuration).
- `.bash_logout`: is run when you log out.
