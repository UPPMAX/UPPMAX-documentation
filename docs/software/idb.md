# `idb`

There are many [debuggers](debuggers.md).
This page described `idb`, the Intel debugger.

`idb` was provided with the Intel [compiler](compiler.md). 
Now it is deprecated and you are advised to use [gdb](gdb.md).
to debug programs compiled with the Intel compiler.
See [gdb](gdb.md) how to do so.
