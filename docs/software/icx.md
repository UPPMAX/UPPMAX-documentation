# `icx`

There are multiple [compilers](compilers.md) on the UPPMAX HPC clusters.
This page describes `icx`, an Intel C compiler.

The Intel compiler is part of the `intel` [module](../cluster_guides/modules.md)
and can be used to:

- [Compile a C program](icx_compile_c.md)

Working together with this Intel compiler are:

- A [debugger](debuggers.md) called [`gdb`](gdb.md)
- An obsolete [debugger](debuggers.md) called [`idb`](idb.md)
- Some general [profiler](profilers.md) called [Intel VTune](intel_vtune.md)
  and [Intel Advisor](intel_advisor.md)
