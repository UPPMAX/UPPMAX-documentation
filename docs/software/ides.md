## Introduction

IDE (pronounce `aj-dee-ee`) is short for 'Integrated Development Environment',
or 'a program in which you do programming'.
The goal of an IDE is to help develop code, with features
such as code completion, code hints and interactive debugging.

There are [many different IDEs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments)),
of which some are tailored to one programming
language (e.g. RStudio) and some allow multiple programming languages.

How to use an IDE depends on the UPPMAX cluster you want to use:

- [IDEs on Rackham](../software/ides_on_rackham.md)

In general, using an IDE is easiest on Rackham and hardest on Bianca.
