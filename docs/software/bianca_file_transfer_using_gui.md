## Overview

As a user, we need to transfer files
between our local computer and Bianca.
There are
[many ways to transfer files to/from Bianca](../cluster_guides/transfer_bianca.md).
On this page, we learn how to transfer files
to Bianca using a graphical tool/program.

There are constraints on which programs
we can use, due to Bianca being an HPC cluster
for sensitive data.
Details are described in 'Bianca's constraints',
here are graphical tools that work:

UPPMAX guide                                                                           |Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------
[File transfer to/from Bianca using FileZilla](bianca_file_transfer_using_filezilla.md)|All operating systems
[File transfer to/from Bianca using WinSCP](bianca_file_transfer_using_winscp.md)      |Windows-only
Cyberduck                                                                              |Mac and Windows only

When using such a graphical tool,
one needs [to be inside of SUNET](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md).

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See [the 'get inside the university networks' page](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

When a tool is setup, one can only transfer files
between you local computer and [your Bianca `wharf` folder](../cluster_guides/wharf.md).
