# Python bundles

For more complex complex Python packages,
there exist [UPPMAX modules](../cluster_guides/modules.md) to load these:

## Biopython

Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological
 computation written in Python by an international team of developers. It is
 a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
 applications which address the needs of current and future work in
 bioinformatics.

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar
 building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs,
 etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter
 Notebook.
