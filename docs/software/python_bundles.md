# Python bundles

For more complex complex Python packages,
there exist [UPPMAX modules](../cluster_guides/modules.md) to load these:

## Biopython

Biopython is a set of freely available tools for biological
 computation written in Python by an international team of developers. It is
 a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python libraries and
 applications which address the needs of current and future work in
 bioinformatics.

## IPython

IPython provides a rich architecture for interactive computing with:
 Powerful interactive shells (terminal and Qt-based).
 A browser-based notebook with support for code, text, mathematical expressions, inline plots and other rich media.
 Support for interactive data visualization and use of GUI toolkits.
 Flexible, embeddable interpreters to load into your own projects.
 Easy to use, high performance tools for parallel computing.

## JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter offering all the familiar
 building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs,
 etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface. JupyterLab will eventually replace the classic Jupyter
 Notebook.
