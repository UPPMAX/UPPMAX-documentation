GNU nano is a simple [terminal](../software/terminal.md) text editor that is easy to learn.

Start nano on a terminal with:

```bash
nano
```

The keyboard shortcuts are shown on-screen,
where `^` denotes `Ctrl` and `M` the meta key.

- On Windows, `Alt` is the meta key
- On Mac: in the `Terminal.app`, go to 'Preferences -> Settings -> Keyboard'
  and turn on "Use option as meta key", after which `Alt` is the meta key
