# UPPMAX cloud

Cloud services allow a user to have something active (typically a website)
that can be accessed by the internet.

The [NAISS 'Swedish Science Cloud (SSC)'](https://www.naiss.se/resource/swedish-science-cloud-ssc/),
consists out of multiple regions.
The eastern region (called `EAST-1`) of SCC is named
'Dis' (the Swedish word for 'haze')
and is hosted by Uppsala
university (the service is called 'UPPMAX cloud')
and Umeå University (north, HPC2N).

## History of Dis

The UPPMAX cloud 'Dis' (Swedish word for 'haze')
and successor of 'Smog' (Swedish for 'smog')
was introduced in October 2017 and upgraded during 2020.

  and dual CPU E5-2660 at 2.2GHz for a total of 16 cores per compute node
- VM flavors for small (2 vCPUs) up to large (16 vCPUs) compute allocations
- 250 TB of total volume storage.
- Interconnect is 10GbE.

Object storage is planned for 2021 but currently unavailable.
