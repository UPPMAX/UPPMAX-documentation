# UPPMAX acknowledgment

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Headers cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

## How should I acknowledge UPPMAX and NAISS in papers, or presentations on workshops or conferences?

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

If the results you get from using the resources at UPPMAX end up in a paper
or are presented at a workshop or conference,
UPPMAX kindly asks you to acknowledge UPPMAX and NAISS.
This helps us ensure continued funding and maintain service levels.

NAISS provides these recommended texts.
We encourage you to visit that page and use those texts when they are relevant.

## In brief

For publications coming out of NAISS projects, please be sure to mention both NAISS and UPPMAX. Here is our recommended formulation:

> "The computations/data handling/[SIMILAR] were/was enabled by resources
> in project [NAISS YYYY/A-BBB] provided by the
> National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS)
> at UPPMAX, funded by the Swedish Research Council through grant agreement
> no. 2022-06725."

For publications coming out of UU-funded UPPMAX projects
(e.g. using [Pelle](pelle.md)),
here is our recommended formulation:

> "The computations/data handling/[SIMILAR] were/was enabled by resources in
> project [UPPMAX YYYY/A-BBB] provided by Uppsala University at UPPMAX."

If applicable, also add acknowledgement for application support:

> `[NAME]` at UPPMAX is acknowledged for assistance concerning
> technical and implementational aspects in making
> the code run on the UPPMAX resources.
