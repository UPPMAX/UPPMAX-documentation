# Rackham's design

[Rackham](rackham.md) is an (general-purpose) high-performance computing (HPC) cluster.

???- question "What is an HPC cluster?"

    What an HPC cluster is, is described [here](uppmax_cluster.md).

Or: Rackham is a group of computers that can effectively run many calculations,
as requested by multiple people, at the same time.
Rackham runs the Linux operating system and all users need some
basic Linux knowledge to use Rackham.

???- tip "Using Linux"

    Using Linux (and especially the so-called command-line/[terminal](../software/terminal.md)) is essential
    to use Rackham. Learning the essential Linux commands
    is described [here](../getting_started/linux.md).
