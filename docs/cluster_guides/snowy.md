# Snowy

Snowy is one of the [UPPMAX clusters](uppmax_cluster.md).

Here we describe [Snowy's name](#snowy's-name)
and [Snowy's design](#snowy's-design).

    [The Snowy portal](snowy_portal.md) 
    is the starting page on using Snowy.

## Snowy's name

Snowy, like all [UPPMAX clusters](uppmax_cluster.md), 
is named after a Tintin character,
in this case after Snowy, Tintin's dog:

???- question "What are the UPPMAX clusters?"

    All UPPMAX clusters can be found [here](uppmax_cluster.md).

## Snowy's design

Snowy is an (general-purpose) high-performance computing (HPC) cluster,
with GPUs and suitable for longer jobs.

???- question "What is an HPC cluster?"

    What an HPC cluster is, is described [here](uppmax_cluster.md).

Or: Snowy is a group of computers that can effectively run many calculations, 
as requested by multiple people, at the same time.
Snowy runs the Linux operating system and all users need some
basic Linux knowledge to use Snowy.

Additionally, Snowy has GPUs and allows for jobs running for maximally 30 days. 

Snowy does not have a login node. Instead, it uses a login node on [Rackham](rackham.md).

???- tip "Using Linux"

    Using Linux (and especially the so-called command-line/terminal) is essential
    to use Snowy. Learning the essential Linux commands 
    is described [here](../getting_started/linux.md).
