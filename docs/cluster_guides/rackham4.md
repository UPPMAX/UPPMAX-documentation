# Rackham4 and Rocky9

!!! info

    - UPPMAX are phasing out the old operating system **CentOS**, that has been installed on all UPPMAX clusters.
    - In the future systems (Pelle and Maja) the Operating System **Rocky9** will be used instead.
    - The transition has started with the Login node ``Rackham4``
    - We are also preparing for building software for several computer architectures; procedures to be used on the future systems.
    - We invite "power users" to test their work here.

!!! warning

    Please inform us of every bug you find, or about missing software.

## About

- The **Rocky9** OS works somewhat differently than **CentOS** and the same "system files" that we had before will not automatically be available directly under Rocky9. 
- This will cause some of our earlier installed software to break. 
- We hope that we has identidied most of them and that you will not notice any changes.
