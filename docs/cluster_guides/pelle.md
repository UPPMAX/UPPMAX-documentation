Pelle is an upcoming general-purpose UPPMAX cluster,
paid by Uppsala University.

Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) will be moved to Pelle
by UPPMAX after [applying to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).

Non-Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) can move their data to
Dardel, see [the Rackham to Dardel migration guide](../cluster_guides/dardel_migration.md).

## Features of Pelle, compared to Rackham

Although we from UPPMAX cannot say exactly how Pelle will look,
we try to have Pelle be as similar to [Rackham](rackham.md) as possible.

## Migration from Rackham to Pelle

As both clusters are UPPMAX clusters,
we will transfer your data from [Rackham](rackham.md)
to Pelle. Users will have to [apply to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).
