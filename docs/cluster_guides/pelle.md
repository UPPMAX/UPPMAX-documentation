Pelle is an upcoming general-purpose UPPMAX cluster,
paid by Uppsala University.

Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) will be moved to Pelle
by UPPMAX after [applying to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).

Non-Uppsala users of [Rackham](rackham.md) can move their data to
Dardel, see [the Rackham to Dardel migration guide](../cluster_guides/dardel_migration.md).

!!! warning "Status"

    Pelle is in the process of being set up. Here is the current
    status of Pelle.

    The delivery of the new UPPMAX system, Pelle, faces continued delays. UPPMAX now has a plan for provisioning Rackham to Uppsala University researchers until Pelle is ready.

    We have started to approve proposals submitted to the UPPMAX Local 2025 round. This will take a little time, but when your project is approved we ask you to examine the decision email closely and let us know if we’re missing any projects for data migration.

    New projects with Pelle and Gorilla resources will not be able to use Pelle or Gorilla until the systems are operational. The projects will have those resources represented in SUPR anyway.

    Approved projects will receive a Rackham allocation, in addition to the resources you asked for, which will let you log in and submit jobs to Rackham.

    Access to storage directories on Crex belonging to UU-affiliated projects will not expire, so you will have continued access to data in UU-affiliated projects on Crex until Pelle is ready. Therefore, most approved projects will not receive a Crex allocation. If we can not identify existing storage allocations for you, then we will create a Crex allocation for your storage needs.

    When Pelle is operational, we will move data from the NAISS projects you’ve mentioned in the proposals to the UPPMAX Local projects for you. Then, we will switch off Rackham and Crex and let you use Pelle and Gorilla.

    The “UPPMAX for Education” service on Snowy will, for now, continue as normal. At some point, we will move the GPUs from Snowy to newer hardware. At the same time, we will add Rackham and/or Pelle allocations to projects and shut down Snowy. We will inform you before we do this.

## [How to apply to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md)

See [how to apply to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).

## Features of Pelle, compared to Rackham

Although we from UPPMAX cannot say exactly how Pelle will look,
we try to have Pelle be as similar to [Rackham](rackham.md) as possible.

## Migration from Rackham to Pelle

As both clusters are UPPMAX clusters,
we will transfer your data from [Rackham](rackham.md)
to Pelle. Users will have to [apply to a Pelle project](../getting_started/project_apply_pelle.md).
