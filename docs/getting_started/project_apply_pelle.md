# Project application for Pelle

To use an UPPMAX cluster, one [needs to apply to a project](project_apply.md).
This page describes how to apply to a [Pelle](../cluster_guides/pelle.md) project.

## Procedure

???- question "Prefer a video?"

    See [the YouTube video 'Apply for an UPPMAX Pelle project'](https://youtu.be/3VOAhPe0Rcg)

### 1. Go to [https://supr.naiss.se/](https://supr.naiss.se/)

???- question "How does that look like?"

    > Example SUPR NAISS main page

### 2. Click on 'Rounds'

On the main page, click on 'Rounds'

???- question "How does that look like?"

    > An UPPMAX local compute project

### 8. Scroll down and add Pelle

In your UPPMAX local compute project, scroll down to 'Resources' and add Pelle.
