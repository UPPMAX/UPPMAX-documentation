# Get started

This page describes how to get started with UPPMAX.

## Step 1: get an UPPMAX user account

First, one needs an an UPPMAX user account.
See how to get one at [the UPPMAX guide 'Apply to a user account'](user_account.md#apply-to-an-uppmax-user-account).

## (optional) Step 2: get a 2FA for your UPPMAX user account

Some parts of UPPMAX require two factor authentication.
See how to set this up at
[the guide 'Setting up two factor authentication for UPPMAX'](get_uppmax_2fa.md).

## Step 3: get an UPPMAX project

Second, one needs to have an active research project.
See how to get one at [the UPPMAX guide 'Apply for a project'](project_apply.md).

## Step 4: use UPPMAX

Now you can use the UPPMAX resources!

- [Login to our clusters](login.md)
- [Transfer files from/to your UPPMAX account](../cluster_guides/file_transfer.md)

To make this step easier,
