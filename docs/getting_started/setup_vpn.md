# Setup a VPN

Some [UPPMAX clusters](../cluster_guides/uppmax_cluster.md) require you
to [have an IP address inside of SUNET](get_inside_sunet.md).
A virtual private network (VPN) allows one to do so: it will use the
Swedish university networks to connect to the UPPMAX clusters.

To be able to use a VPN to [get inside of SUNET](get_inside_sunet.md):

- For other Swedish universities, search their websites to get the required VPN credentials.
