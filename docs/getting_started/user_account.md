# UPPMAX User Accounts

An UPPMAX user account is needed to use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md)
resources.

To apply for an UPPMAX user account, complete the following steps:

- [Register at SUPR](supr_register.md).
- Make sure that you don't already have an account at SUPR.
  You must not have more than one account in SUPR.
- [Accept the user agreement in SUPR](supr_register.md#accept-the-user-agreement).

With your UPPMAX user account, you can now
[apply to an UPPMAX project](project_apply.md) to use the UPPMAX resources.
