# UPPMAX User Accounts

An UPPMAX user account is needed to use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md)
resources (together with [an active UPPMAX research project](project.md))
and allows you to [log in](login.md) into the UPPMAX clusters.

## Apply to an UPPMAX user account

To apply for an UPPMAX user account, you (the user)
and the PI of the project (the researcher
in charge of the research project) must complete the following steps:

- You should visit the national project management platform SUPR and register there.
- Make sure that you don't already have an account at SUPR.
  You must not have more than one account in SUPR.
- You must accept the user agreement in SUPR, either online or in paper form.
- Become a member of a project:
  - If you are a PI: apply for a project in SUPR.
  - If you are not a PI: Apply for membership in a project you want to join in SUPR, Wait for the PI to accept your application. Alternatively, the PI can add you directly.
- You must apply for an account at UPPMAX in SUPR.

After the 4 steps are completed your account will be created at UPPMAX
within 2 working days and you will receive two emails with information
on how to access the UPPMAX resources.
