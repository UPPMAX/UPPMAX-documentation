## Setting up an UPPMAX 2FA token

Go to [https://suprintegration.uppmax.uu.se/bootstrapotp/](https://suprintegration.uppmax.uu.se/bootstrapotp/)
to initiate the token
creation. This should take you to a landing page with some initial
information and let you know that you will be sent to SUPR to log in.

???- question "How does that look like?"

Once you click "Continue", you'll be sent to SUPR where you should log in.
Once you've done so SUPR will let you know that you will be sent back
and the identity you are logged in with.

    When you store your SUPR 2FA recovery somewhere,
    it will take around 10 minutes to get a new 2FA token.
