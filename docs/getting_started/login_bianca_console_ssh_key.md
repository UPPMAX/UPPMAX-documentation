# Login to the Bianca console environment using SSH keys

There are multiple ways to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md).

This page describes how to [log in to Bianca](login_bianca.md)
using a [terminal](../software/terminal.md) and an SSH key pair.

!!! warning "Unsure on which platforms this works"

    It is unsure on which operating systems this works.

    Operating system|Status
    ----------------|---------------------
    Linux, Ubuntu   |Confirmed not to work
    MacOS           |Rumored not to work
    Windows         |Rumored to work


## 1. Get inside SUNET

When inside SUNET, one can access a Bianca console environment
using SSH and SSH keys.

???- question "Forgot how to get within SUNET?"

    See [the 'get inside the university networks' page](../getting_started/get_inside_sunet.md)

This is considered a bit harder to setup,
but one only needs to type one password to login to Bianca.
If you don't mind typing your UPPMAX password twice,
an easier setup is [log in to the Bianca console environment with a password](login_bianca_console_password.md).

## 2. Use `ssh` to log in

From a [terminal](../software/terminal.md), use [`ssh`](../software/ssh.md) to log in:

```bash
ssh -A [user]@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

For example:

```bash
ssh -A sven@bianca.uppmax.uu.se
```

???- question "How does it look like when outside of SUNET?"

    See [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/W-PMTyNcbYI?t=79)
    how this looks like when outside of SUNET.

    Spoiler: quite dull, as nothing happens until these is a timeout.

???- question "Why no `-X`?"

    On Rackham, one can use `-X`:

    ```bash
    ssh -X username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
    ```

    However, on Bianca, this so-called
    [X forwarding](../software/ssh_x_forwarding.md) is disabled.
    Hence, we do not teach it :-)

## 3. Type your UPPMAX password

Type your UPPMAX password.

???- question "How does this look like?"

    ```bash
    $ ssh -A sven@bianca.uppmax.uu.se

    Provide your normal UPPMAX password. You will supply the TOTP code separately, in the next step.

    (sven@bianca.uppmax.uu.se) Password:
    (sven@bianca.uppmax.uu.se)
    ```

## 4. Type your TOTP

Type your UPPMAX TOTP.

???- question "How does this look like?"

    ```bash
    Second factor (TOTP UPPMAX):
    ```

## 5. Type your Bianca project's name

Type your Bianca project's name.

???- question "How does this look like?"

    ```bash
    Project name (pick from sens2016001 sens2017625 sens2023598): sens2017625
    ```

## 6. You are in

Enjoy! You are in! To be precise,
you are on a Bianca [login node](../cluster_guides/login_node.md).

!!! note "How to behave on a login node"

    On a login node, one can and should do simple things only:
    it is a resource shared with all other users on that node.

    If you need to do more intense calculations,
    [use the Slurm job scheduler](../cluster_guides/slurm_on_rackham.md).

    If you need to do more intense calculations interactively,
    [use an interactive session](../cluster_guides/start_interactive_session_on_rackham.md).

In a Bianca console environment:

- Text display is limited to 50kBit/s.
  This means that if you create a lot of text output,
  you will have to wait some time before you get your prompt back.
- Cut, copy and paste work as usual.
  Be careful to not copy-paste sensitive data!

???- question "Why does one need two passwords?"

    The first password is needed to get into the shared Bianca environment.
    This password contains both an UPPMAX password and an UPPMAX 2FA number.

    The second password is needed to go to the login node
    of a project's virtual cluster.
