!!! note "Apply for a project here"

    See [here](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/create-account-and-apply-for-project/apply-for-projects)
    to apply for a project.

To use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md) resources, one needs:

- [an active research project](project.md)
- [an UPPMAX user account](user_account.md)

This page is about applying for an UPPMAX project.

See [here](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/create-account-and-apply-for-project/apply-for-projects) to apply for a project.

???- question "I just got an UPPMAX project, yet I cannot login to UPPMAX?"

    It tends to be a matter of minutes to less than hours
    before the changes propagate from SUPR to UPPMAX.

    If after one night you cannot login,
    please [contact support](../support.md).
