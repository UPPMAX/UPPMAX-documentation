I, Richel, commented out this text, as it:

- 1. does not work, as reported in https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/issues/117
- 2. it breaks the Markdown lint check
- 3. seems experimental

To use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md) resources, one needs:

- [an active research project](project.md)
- [an UPPMAX user account](user_account.md)

This page is about applying for an UPPMAX project:

- [Apply for a Bianca project](project_apply_bianca.md), i.e. a project
  using sensitive data
- [Apply for a SIMPLER project](project_apply_simpler.md),
  i.e. a project for the Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-based Life-course and Environmental Research
- [Other applications](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/create-account-and-apply-for-project/apply-for-projects)

Alternatively, one can [join an existing project](join_existing_project.md).

???- question "I just got an UPPMAX project, yet I cannot login to UPPMAX?"

    It tends to be a matter of minutes to less than hours
    before the changes propagate from SUPR to UPPMAX.

    If after one night you cannot login,
    please [contact support](../support.md).
