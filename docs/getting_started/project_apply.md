# Project application

To use [UPPMAX](../cluster_guides/uppmax.md) resources, one needs:

- [an active research project](project.md)
- [an UPPMAX user account](user_account.md)

Your user account is a personal log-in to our systems. Computer resources like CPU-hours and disk storage are allocated to projects.

The workflow is like this:

    - Register in SUPR
    - Accept SUPR user agreement
    - Become a member of a project
    - Apply for an account at UPPMAX (or other resources)

!!! warning

    Note that you can only get a user account on a resource if you belong to a project with allocations there!

## SUPR account

???- question "Get a SUPR account"

    - You should visit the national project management platform [SUPR](https://supr.naiss.se/) and [register](https://supr.naiss.se/person/register/) there.
        - Make sure that you don't already have an account at SUPR. You must not have more than one account in SUPR.
    - All steps [here](supr_register.md).

???- question "Accept SUPR user agreement"

    - You must accept the user agreement in SUPR, either online or in paper form.
    - Details [here](supr_register.md#accept-the-user-agreement).

## Applying for an UPPMAX project (PI)

If you are a PI: apply for a project in SUPR.

- [Apply for a Bianca project](project_apply_bianca.md), i.e. a project
  using sensitive data
- [Apply for a Pelle project](project_apply_pelle.md), i.e. a project
  for the new Uppsala-local general-purpose cluster
- [Apply for a SIMPLER project](project_apply_simpler.md),
  i.e. a project for the Swedish Infrastructure for Medical Population-based Life-course and Environmental Research
- [Other applications](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/create-account-and-apply-for-project/apply-for-projects)

## Become a member of a project

If you are not a PI: Apply for membership in a project you want to join in SUPR, Wait for the PI to accept your application. Alternatively, the PI can add you directly.

- [join an existing project](join_existing_project.md).

???- question "I just got an UPPMAX project, yet I cannot login to UPPMAX?"

    It tends to be a matter of minutes to less than hours
    before the changes propagate from SUPR to UPPMAX.

    If after one night you cannot login,
    please [contact support](../support.md).

## Apply for an account at UPPMAX

If you don't already have an account at UPPMAX you are ready by now!
