# UPPMAX support

If you lost your UPPMAX password, see [how to reset your UPPMAX password](getting_started/reset_uppmax_password.md).

If you need other help on using UPPMAX,
you preferably contact us through the [Support Form](https://supr.naiss.se/support/).
If that does not work, use `support@uppmax.uu.se`.

If you want to contribute, see [how to contribute](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you need general Uppsala University IT support,
use the Uppsala University IT Servicedesk.

If you plan a course using UPPMAX resources, see
[What should I think about when planning a course using UPPMAX resources](https://www.uu.se/en/centre/uppmax/get-started/create-account-and-apply-for-project/apply-for-projects/course/planning-a-course)
