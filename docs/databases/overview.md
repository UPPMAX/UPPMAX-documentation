# Overview of databases

Many commonly used data sources are stored locally at UPPMAX. This page provides an index to pages where they are described in more detail.
Available databases:

    [BLAST databases available locally](./blast.md)
    [NCBI taxonomy databases]
    [DIAMOND protein alignment databases]
    [Reference genomes]
    [1000-genome project]
    [Simons Genome Diversity Project datasets]
    [Other bioinformatics-oriented local data resources]

In order for you to access Swegen (or 1000 genomes) you must first send an email to datacentre@scilifelab.se and ask for access. When they approve you, they will contact UPPMAX and we will grant access to Swegen.
