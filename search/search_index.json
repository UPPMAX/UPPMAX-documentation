The first tool fqzcomp (available in the module fqzcomp/4.6) uses a compiled executable (fqz_comp) that works similar to e.g., gzip, while the second tool (LFQC in the module lfqc/1.1) uses separate ruby-language scripts for compression (lfqc.rb) and decompression (lfqcd.rb). It does not appear the LFQC scripts accept piping but the documentation is limited.</p> <p>Loading the needed modules:</p> <pre><code>module load bioinfo-tools\nmodule load fqzcomp/4.6\nmodule load lfqc/1.1\n</code></pre> <p>Both modules have 'module help' available for more info. The help for fqzcomp gives the location of their README which is very helpful in describing minor changes that might occur to the FastQ file during decompression (these do not affect the read name, sequence or quality data).</p> <p>One thing changed from the 'standard' implementation of LFQC was to make the scripts stand-alone with #! header lines, rather than requiring e.g., 'ruby lfqc.rb ...' as you see in their documentation.</p> <p>Since piping is not available with LFQC, it is preferable to avoid creating a large intermediate decompressed FastQ file. So, create a named pipe using mkfifo that is named like a fastq file.</p> <pre><code>mkfifo UME_081102_P05_WF03.se.fastq\nzcat UME_081102_P05_WF03.se.fastq.gz &gt; UME_081102_P05_WF03.se.fastq &amp;\nlfqc.rb UME_081102_P05_WF03.se.fastq\nrm UME_081102_P05_WF03.se.fastq\n</code></pre> <p>This took a long time, 310 wall seconds.</p> <p>Next,fqz_comp from fqzcomp/4.6.

There are other compression options (we tried -s1 and -s9+) but these did not outperform the default (equivalent to -s3). This is not necessarily a surprise; stronger compression means attempting to make better guesses and sometimes these guesses are not correct.

An additional consideration is how useful the compressed format will be to you later. Some tools can handle only one compressed format (almost always gzip) and some can handle two (almost always gzip and bzip2). The help information for the tool should be explicit about which formats it understands. You can also use named pipes or the bash &lt;() syntax to uncompress files 'on the fly' if the tool you are using cannot handle that compressed format.</p> <p>Another consideration for usefulness is the structure of the specific compressed format. By default gzip is not 'blocked'; the compression is applied continually across the entire file, and to uncompress something in the middle it is necessary to uncompress everything up to that point. Tools that understand compressed VCF and GFF files require these to be compressed with bgzip (available as part of the htslib module), which applies blocked gzip compression, so that it is possible to uncompress interior chunks of the files efficiently. This is useful when viewing compressed VCF/GFF files in a viewer such as IGV, for example. For viewing, such files also need an index created, which is accomplished using tabix (also part of the htslib module), which understands bgzip-compressed files. BAM files also use a type of gzip compression that is blocked. Files compressed with bgzip can be uncompressed with gzip.</p> <p>Bzip2 is inherently blocked. Bzip2 is a more efficient compression method than gzip, but takes perhaps twice as long or longer to compress the same file. Fortunately, another advantage of blocked compression is that multiple parts of the file can be compressed at once. Uppmax has pbzip2 available as a system tool, which can perform parallel compression and decompression of bzip2-format files using multiple threads. This is quite fast. Do 'pbzip2 -h' for help. An Uppmax user has provided a helpful SBATCH script.</p> <p>Another disadvantage of compression formats that are not blocked is that an error in a file generally screws up the remainder of the file. Files with blocked compression can recover all non-error-containing blocks.</p> <p>Other compressed formats are available, including 7z, available by loading the p7zip module, and xz, available as the system tool xz and by loading the liblzma module. For compressing FastQ files in particular, which have a very strict format, our small-scale comparison of tools showed that xz was slightly inferior to bzip2 and much slower during compression, and specialty tools for FastQ compression were superior in compression ratios to general-purpose compressors. See How Should I Compress FastQ-format Files? for more on FastQ compression.</p> <p>Most compression tools have options that allow you to trade off between speed of compression and size reduction of compression. The defaults are almost always sufficient.</p> <p>It makes little sense to compress an already-compressed file with a different format. It is much better to set up a pipe to uncompress the file and then recompress in the new format.</p> <p>Apart from compression dictated by file usage (see above), it is recommended that files that are being compressed for long-term storage (e.g., raw sequence data) are compressed using pbzip2. If the files are already compressed in long-term storage (e.g. Swestore) I don't think it is worthwhile to retrieve the files, decompress-recompress them, then reupload them.</p>"},{"location":"cluster_guides/compress_guide/","title":"Brief compression guide","text":""},{"location":"cluster_guides/compress_guide/#brief-compression-guide","title":"Brief compression guide","text":"<p>To avoid filling up the storage at UPPMAX, we all users to do their part and store their files in a good way.

You may want to use one or several compute nodes as a development workbench, interactively. How can this be arranged? The program <code>interactive</code> may be what you are looking for.</p> <p>The best way to use the command is usually to add as few parameters as possible, because the <code>interactive</code> command tries to find an optimal solution to give you a high queue priority and thus a quick job start. If you have a clear idea about what parameters you need, please specify them, otherwise it might be a good idea to first see what you get with fewer parameters.</p> <p>The one parameter you must always specify is the project name. Let's assume for this article that your project name is p2010099.</p> <p>To get one compute core with the proportional amount of RAM, we recommend you to use the most simple command on the login node for the cluster you want to use:</p> <pre><code>interactive -A p2010099\n</code></pre> <p>If you need more than one core, or special features on your node, you can specify that to the interactive command, e.g. on milou:</p> <pre><code>interactive -A p2010099 -n 16 -C fat\n</code></pre> <p>as if it was an sbatch command. Actually, interactive is implemented partly as an sbatch command and you can use most sbatch flags here. Please note that only a few nodes are fat, so you may have to wait for quite a long time to get your session started.</p> <p>There are three ways to get a priority boost, and the interactive command knows how to use them all:</p> <p>Internally using the sbatch flag \"--qos=interact\", that allows a single-node job with a timelimit of up to 12 hours. (Please note that you are not allowed to keep more than one \"--qos=interact\" jobs in the batch system simultaneously, and please note that you can not use this \"priority lane\" when you have oversubscribed your 30 days running core hour allocation.) Internally using the special devel partition, that allows the job to use 1-4 nodes, with a timelimit of up to one hour. (Please note that you are not allowed to keep more than one \"devel\" job in the batch system simultaneously, regardless if they are running or merely queued.) Internally using the sbatch flag \"--qos=short\", that allows the job to use 1-4 nodes, with a timelimit of up to 15 minutes. (Please note that your are not allowed to keep more than two \"short\" jobs in the batch system simultaneously.) If you do not specify any timelimit, the interactive command will give you the maximum timelimit allowed, according to the rules for priority boosts.</p> <p>In the last example (\"interactive -A p2010099 -n 16 -C fat\"), the interactive command can not use \"priority lane\" 1 above, because it uses more than one node (one node contains eight cores, two nodes contain a total of sixteen cores), and it can not use \"priority lane\" 2 above, because the special devel partition contains no fat nodes, so the interactive command tries to give you a high-priority 15-minute job.</p> <p>If you also want to run for 15 hours, you may say so, with the command</p> <pre><code>interactive -A p2010099 -n 16 -C fat -t 15:00:00\n</code></pre> <p>but no \"priority lane\" can be used, you get your normal queue priority, and you might have to wait for a very long time for your session to start. Please note that you need to keep watch over when the job starts, because you are accounted for all the time from job start even if you are sleeping, and because an allocated and unused node is a waste of expensive resources.</p> <p>NB. You can not launch an interactive job from an other cluster with the flag -M, which otherwise is a common flag to other Slurm commands.

Additionally, the metadata server on these kinds of file systems can be overburdened if very large numbers of files are created and/or removed.</p> <p>For this reason, jobs that perform a lot of file accesses, especially on temporary files, should use the compute node's local hard drive.

The idea is that you copy files that you will be reading randomly, such as indices and databases but not files of reads, to <code>$SNIC_TMP</code> first thing in the job. Files that you read as a stream from beginning to end, like files of reads, should remain in project storage and read from there.

These values are appropriate for a\n# full standard rackham node.\nbwa mem -t 16 $SNIC_TMP/hg19.fa /proj/snic2022-X-YYY/rawdata/sample.fq.gz | samtools sort -@ 4 -m 20G -O bam - &gt; $SNIC_TMP/sample.bam\n\n# copy the results back to the network file system\ncp $SNIC_TMP/sample.bam /proj/snic2022-X-YYY/nobackup/results/\n</code></pre> <p>It's not harder than that. This way, the index files are copied to $SNIC_TMP in a single operation, which is much less straining for the file system than small random read/writes. The network filesystem is used when gathering reads for alignment, and streaming reads are easy for that filesystem. When the alignment is finished the results is copied back to project directory so that it can be used in other analysis.</p> <p>One problem that can happen is if your files and the results are too large for the node's hard drive. The drive is 2TiB on Rackham and 4TiB on Bianca, so it is unusual for the hard drive to be too small for the results of such analyses.

Rich text files and PDF's often replace symbols like quotes and white space with different symbols to improve readability, and copying from sources like these is generally not a good idea.</p> <p>Another possible reason is that lines of text files are terminated differently on UNIX/Windows/MAC. Read on for information on how to solve this:</p> <p>This might happen because your file was created, for instance, on a Windows computer and later copied to UPPMAX Linux machines. Text files have different line terminations on for instance Windows and Linux/Unix. If this is an ordinary textfile you can test this by using the \"file\" command, like this:</p> <pre><code>$ file myfile\nmyfile: ASCII text, with CRLF line terminators\n</code></pre> <p><code>CRLF terminators</code> tells you that each line of the file is ended by both a carriage-return and a line-feed, as on Windows. On all UPPMAX systems, the file can simply be converted to UNIX style text files using the \"dos2unix\" command:</p> <pre><code>$ dos2unix myfile\ndos2unix: converting file myfile to UNIX format ...\n</code></pre> <p>Checking the file again with the \"file\" command reveals that it now has ordinary UNIX line terminators (only LF):</p> <pre><code>$ file myfile\nmyfile: ASCII text\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, a file from a Mac can be converted using the \"mac2unix\" command.</p> <p>If a shell script is behaving strangely, it can be due to the same problem.

Opening the same file in emacs reveals the same thing (-uu-(DOS)---F1 myscript.sh). Convert the script to unix-format using the \"dos2unix\" command as described above.

To see what modules you have loaded, type <code>module list</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Note. For the batch system slurm to work with modules you must have</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash -l\n</code></pre> <p>in your submit script.</p> <ul> <li>For more information, read the module system guide</li> </ul> What is causing the sbatch script error 'Unknown shell type <code>load</code>'? <ul> <li>If you're getting the error message</li> </ul> <pre><code>init.c(379):ERROR:109: Unknown shell type load\n</code></pre> <p>when running your sbatch script, then your script is probably starting with the line</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash\n</code></pre> <p>To remedy this you need to make sure that your script starts with</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash -l\n</code></pre> <p>i.e. notice the trailing \"-l\". This tells bash to load the correct environment settings, which makes the module system usable.</p> I get <code>slurmstepd: error: _get_pss:ferror() /proc/$$/smaps</code> <p>Sometimes, this error message occurs in the Slurm output file: <code>slurmstepd: error: _get_pss: ferror() indicates error on file /proc/$$/smaps</code></p> <p>This error does not affect the results and can be ignored.</p> <p>Statistics are collected when a job has finished, including PSS, which is a measure of memory usage. The error message means that when Slurm tries to collect all info to calculate PSS, the file exposing kernel statistics for the process is already gone. This is probably due to the cleaning process being slightly out of sync.</p> <p>Job statistics based on the PSS value, like how much memory a job has used, might not be reliable. But since this is something that happens after the job has finished, results should not be affected.</p> How can I see my job's memory usage? <ul> <li> <p>Historical information can first of all be found by issuing the command <code>finishedjobinfo -j</code>. That will print out the maximum memory used by your job.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you want more details then we also save some memory information each 5 minute interval for the job in a file under <code>/sw/share/slurm/[cluster-name]/uppmax_jobstats/</code>. Notice that this is only stored for 30 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can also ask for an e-mail containing the log, when you submit your job with sbatch or start an \"interactive\" session, by adding a \"-C usage_mail\" flag to your command. Two examples:</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>sbatch -A testproj -p core -n 5 -C usage_mail batchscript1\n</code></pre> <p>or, if interactive</p> <pre><code>interactive -A testproj -p node -n 1 -C \"fat&amp;usage_mail\"\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>As you see, you have to be careful with the syntax when asking for two features, like \"fat\" and \"usage_mail\", at the same time. The logical AND operator \"&amp;\" combines the flags.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you overdraft the RAM that you asked for, you will probably get an automatic e-mail anyway.</p> </li> <li> <p>If, on the other hand, you want to view your memory consumption in real time then you will have to login to the node in question in another SSH session. (You will probably find a more recently updated memory information file there, named /var/spool/uppmax_jobstats/.)</p> </li> <li> <p>By naively looking at the memory consumption with tools like <code>ps</code> and <code>top</code> you as a user can easily get the wrong impression of the system, as the Linux kernel uses free memory for lots of buffers and caches to speed up other processes (but releases this as soon as applications requests it).</p> </li> <li> <p>If you know that you are the only user running on the node (from requesting a node job for example), then you could issue the command \"free -g\" instead. That will show you how much memory is used/free by the whole system, exclusive to these caches. Look for the row called \"-/+ buffers/cache\".</p> </li> <li> <p>If you require more detailed live information,   then it would probably be best if the tool called <code>smem</code> is used.   Download the latest version from http://www.selenic.com/smem/download/ and unpack it in your home directory.   Inside you will find an executable Python script, and by executing the command <code>smem -utk</code> you will see your user's memory usage reported in three different ways.</p> <ul> <li>USS is the total memory used by the user without shared buffers or caches.</li> <li>RSS is the number reported in \"top\" and \"ps\"; i.e. including ALL shared buffered/cached memory.</li> <li>And then there's also the PSS figure which tries to calculate a proportional memory usage per user for all shared memory buffers and caches (i.e. the figure will fall between USS and RSS).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> My job has very low priority! What can be wrong? <ul> <li> <p>One reason could be that your project has consumed its allocated hours.</p> </li> <li> <p>Background: Every job is associated with a project.</p> <ul> <li>Suppose that that you are working for a SNIC project s00101-01 that's been granted 10000 core hours per 30-days running.</li> <li>At the start of the project, s00101-01 is credited with 10000 hours and jobs that runs in that project are given a high priority.</li> <li>All the jobs that are finished or are running during the last 30 days is compared with this granted time.</li> <li>If enough jobs have run to consume this amount of hours the priority is lowered.</li> <li>The more you have overdrafted your granted time, the lower the priority.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If you have overdrafted your granted time it's still possible to run jobs. You will probably wait for a longer time in the queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>To check status for your projects, run</p> </li> </ul> <pre><code>$ projinfo\n(Counting the number of core hours used since 2010-05-12/00:00:00 until now.)\n\nProject             Used[h]   Current allocation [h/month]\nUser\n-----------------------------------------------------\ns00101-01          72779.48               50000\nsome-user       72779.48\n</code></pre> <ul> <li> <p>If there are enough jobs left in projects that have not gone over their allocation, jobs associated with this project are therefore stuck wating at the bottom of the jobinfo list until the usage for the last 30 days drops down under its allocated budget again.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the other side they may be lucky to get some free nodes, so it could happen that they run as a bonus job before this happens.</p> </li> <li> <p>The job queue, that you can see with the jobinfo command, is ordered on job priority. Jobs with a high priority will run first, if they can (depending on number of free nodes and any special demands on e.g. memory).</p> </li> <li> <p>Job priority is the sum of the following numbers (you may use the sprio command to get exact numbers for individual jobs):</p> <ul> <li>A high number (100000 or 130000) if your project is within its allocation and a lower number otherwise. There are different grades of lower numbers, depending on how many times your project is overdrafted. As an example, a 2000 core hour project gets priority 70000 when it has used more than 2000 core hours, gets priority 60000 when it has used more than 4000 core hours, gets priority 50000 when it has used more than 6000 core hours, and so on. The lowest grade gives priority 10000 and does not go down from there.</li> <li>The number of minutes the job has been waiting in queue (for a maximum of 20160 after fourteen days).</li> <li>A job size number, higher for more nodes allocated to your job, for a maximum of 104.</li> <li>A very, very high number for \"short\" jobs, i.e. very short jobs that is not wider than four nodes.</li> <li>If your job priority is zero or one, there are more serious problems, for example that you asked for more resources than the batch system finds on the system.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If you ask for a longer run time (TimeLimit) than the maximum on the system, your job will not run. The maximum is currently ten days. If you must run a longer job, submit it with a ten-day runtime and contact UPPMAX support.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"cluster_guides/slurm/","title":"Slurm","text":"","tags":["slurm","Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management"]},{"location":"cluster_guides/slurm/#slurm","title":"Slurm","text":"<p>The UPPMAX clusters are a shared resource.

There are some policies regarding this, that we ask that you follow:</p> <pre><code>You may be given access to the project before the course; please do not use the allocation for running your own codes in. Usage of the project before the course means the priority of jobs submitted to it goes down, diminishing the opportunity for you and your fellow participants to run the examples during the course. You can read more detailed information about the job policies of NSC here and NSC usage rules here.\nThe course project will be open 1-2 weeks after the course, giving the participants the opportunity to test run examples and shorter codes related to the course.

Within this folder, \"low\" holds the primary dataset with one individual per folder (eg, \"HG00096\", \"NA11831\") holding data files for each sequencing technology applied. In the main folder, \"high\" holds the high-coverage data for a subset of the individuals.</p> <p>One level up in the file system, /sw/data/KGP/regional holds sequence data for some individual countries outside the 1000-genome project.

The purple nodes are about file transfer, the blue nodes are about 'doing other things'. In this session, we will transfer files between 'Files on user computer' and 'Files in wharf' using a graphical tool, e.g. FileZilla</p> <p>Bianca is an HPC cluster for sensitive data. To protect that sensitive data, Bianca has no direct internet connection. This means that files cannot be downloaded directly.</p> What is an HPC cluster again? <p>See the UPPMAX page on HPC clusters.</p> <p>Instead, one needs to learn one of the many ways to do secure file transfer.</p> <p>Here, we show how to transfer files using a graphical tool called FileZilla.</p> <p>In general, one can pick any graphical tools with these constraints:</p> <ul> <li>the tool must support SFTP</li> <li>the tool must not store a password</li> </ul> <p>Whatever tool one picks, it must do secure file transfer. For secure file transfer, Bianca supports the SFTP protocol. So, for secure file transfer to Bianca, one needs a tool that supports SFTP.</p> Use SFTP ... and why users think incorrectly that SCP will work <p>Only SFTP will work. SCP will never work.</p> <p>However, some users use tools that support SFTP, yet that have 'SCP' in the name, for example, 'WinSCP'. As users hear from colleagues that the tool 'WinSCP' works, they may incorrectly conclude that SCP will work.</p> <p>SCP will never work.

The jobid of your finished jobs can be found with the finishedjobinfo command.</li> <li>POS: This is a numbering of the lines, by jobinfo, after sorting with PRIORITY as first key and JOBID as the second. This is an approximation of the queue position.</li> <li>PARTITION: A Slurm partition is a set of compute nodes, together with some rules about how jobs must be handled, if they ask for this partition. An UPPMAX cluster normally sports the \"devel\", \"core\" and \"node\" partitions.</li> <li>NAME: This is the job name, specified at submission time with the \"-J\" or \"--job-name\" flag. This name can help you to keep track of what the job was meant to do.</li> <li>ACCOUNT: The specified project name, to keep track of how many core hours each project has needed. The projinfo command sums up those core hours.</li> <li>ST: Means status. Status \"PD\" means pending (waiting), status \"R\" means running, status \"CG\" means completing (the job has finished, but the clean-up after the job is not finished yet).</li> <li>START_TIME: An estimation about when the job will start, if all jobs run until the end of their timelimit. You can make guesses about when nodes gets free also by looking at the TIME_LEFT column of running jobs. Slurm computes START_TIME only when it needs the information, i.e. you can not find that information for all jobs.</li> <li>TIME_LEFT: The specified timelimit for the job.

Some are explained here:<ul> <li>AssociationJobLimit: probably means that the job never will start, because it breaks some system limit, set by UPPMAX.</li> <li>BeginTime: says that the user has specified that the job must not start until some specified time in the future.</li> <li>Dependency: means that the job will not start until some special other job(s) has (have) finished.</li> <li>JobHeldAdmin: means that some systems administrator has told that the job must not start.</li> <li>JobHeldUser: means that the job owner has told that job must not start.</li> <li>None: might mean that Slurm has not yet had time to put a reason there.</li> <li>Priority, ReqNodeNotAvail, and Resources: are the normal reasons for waiting jobs, meaning that your job can not start     yet, because free nodes for your job are not found.</li> <li>QOSResourceLimit: means that the job has asked for a QOS and that some limit for that QOS has been reached. The job can not start as long as the limit still is reached.</li> <li>QOSJobLimit: probably means that the job can never start, because it breaks some system limit, set by UPPMAX.</li> </ul> </li> <li>FEATURES: There are quite a few of these and some are explained here:<ul> <li>null: means that no special features have been asked for.</li> <li>fat: means that a fat node (a node with a more-than-standard -- for this cluster -- amount of memory) is needed.</li> <li>null: means that no special features have been asked for.</li> <li>thin: means that a standard (i.e. non-fat) node must be used, and this feature is automatically set for most jobs with no memory requirements and a high timelimit, so the job will not unnecessarily hog a fat node for a long time.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"software/jobstats/","title":"jobstats","text":""},{"location":"software/jobstats/#jobstats","title":"<code>jobstats</code>","text":"<p>An example plot produced by <code>jobstats</code></p> <p><code>jobststats</code> is an UPPMAX tool to enable discovery of resource usage for jobs submitted to the Slurm job queue.</p> <p>At this page, it is described:</p> <ul> <li><code>jobstats --plot</code>: How to use is <code>jobstats --plot</code> to see resource use in a graphical plot</li> <li>Efficient use: How to use your resources efficiently</li> <li>Examples: Examples of ineffective resource use plots</li> <li>Other <code>jobstats</code> functionality<ul> <li>Using <code>jobstats --help</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"software/jobstats/#jobstats-plot","title":"<code>jobstats --plot</code>","text":"<p>With the <code>--plot</code> (or <code>-p</code>) option, a plot is produced showing the resource use per node for a job that completed successfully and took longer than 5 minutes.</p> <p>There are many ways to use <code>--plot</code>, a minimal use could be:</p> <pre><code>jobstats --plot [job_id]\n</code></pre> <p>for example:</p> <pre><code>jobstats --plot 12345678\n</code></pre> <p>The produced plot will be produced in the local folder with name <code>[cluster_name]-[project_name]-[user_name]-[jobid].png</code>, for example <code>rackham-uppmax1234-sven-876543.png</code>.

Plots contain one panel per booked node showing CPU (blue) and memory\nusage (black) traces and include text lines indicating the job number, cluster,\nend time and duration, user, project, job name, and usage flags (more on those\nbelow).

Also, if a job booked nodes\ninefficiently by not using nodes it asked for, jobstats files will not be\navailable for the booked but unused nodes.\n\nJOBSTATS DISCOVERY\n------------------\n\nThere are five modes for discovery, depending on what the user provides on the\ncommand line: (1) discovery by job number for a completed job; (2) discovery by\njob number for a currently running job; (3) discovery by node and job number,\nfor a completed or running job; (4) discovery by project; or (5) discovery via\ninformation provided on 'stdin'.  In each of the example command lines below, the\n-p/--plot option requests that plots of job resource usage are created.\n\nMode 1:  jobstats -p jobid1 jobid2 jobid3\n-------\nJob numbers valid on the cluster.  [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) is used to determine further\ninformation for each job.  If multiple queries are expected, it might be quicker\nto run [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) yourself separately, see Mode 5 below.  See Mode 2 for a\ncurrently running job.\n\nMode 2:  jobstats -p -r jobid1 jobid2 jobid3\n-------\nJob numbers of jobs currently running on the cluster.  The Slurm squeue tool is\nused to determine further information for each running job.\n\nMode 3:  jobstats -p -n m15,m16 jobid\n-------\n[finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) is *not* called and Uppmax's stored job statistics files are\ndiscovered directly.  If you know which node(s) your job ran on or which nodes\nyou are interested in, this will be much faster than Mode 1.\n\nMode 4:  jobstats -p -A project\n-------\nWhen providing a project name that is valid for the cluster, [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) is\nused to determine further information on jobs run within the project.  As for\nMode 1, this can be rather slow.  Furthermore only [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) defaults for\ntime span etc. are used for job discovery.  If multiple queries are expected or\nadditional [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) options are desired, see Mode 5 below.\n\nMode 5:  [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) project | jobstats - -p\n-------\nAccept input on stdin formatted like [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) output.  The long form of\nthis option is '--stdin'.  This mode can be especially useful if multiple\nqueries of the same job information are expected.  In this case, save the\noutput of a single comprehensive [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) query, and extract the parts\nof interest and present them to this script on stdin.  For example, to produce\nanalyses of all completed jobs in a project during the current calendar year,\nand produce separate tarballs analysing all jobs and providing jobstats plots\nfor each user during this same period:\n\n     [finishedjobinfo](finishedjobinfo.md) -y project &gt; proj-year.txt\n     grep 'jobstat=COMPLETED' proj-year.txt | jobstats - &gt; all-completed-jobs.txt\n     grep 'username=user1' proj-year.txt | jobstats - -p &gt; user1-jobs.txt\n     tar czf user1-jobs.tar.gz user1-jobs.txt *-project-user1-*.png\n     grep 'username=user2' proj-year.txt | jobstats - -p &gt; user2-jobs.txt\n     tar czf user2-jobs.tar.gz user2-jobs.txt *-project-user2-*.png\n     ...\n\nCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS\n--------------------\n\n    -p | --plot        Produce CPU and memory usage plot for each jobid\n\n    -r | --running     Jobids are for jobs currently running on the cluster.

If the -p/--plot command line option\nis provided, a plot is created of core and memory usage across the life of the\njob.  The name of the file produced has the format:\n\n    cluster-project-user-jobid.png\n\nUnless the -q/--quiet option is provided, a table is also produces containing\nlines with the following tab-separated fields:\n\n  jobid cluster jobstate user project endtime runtime flags booked cores node[,node...] jobstats[,jobstats...]\n\nField contents:\n\n  jobid    : Job ID\n  cluster  : Cluster on which the job was run\n  jobstate : End status of the job: COMPLETED, RUNNING, FAILED, TIMEOUT, CANCELLED\n  user     : Username that submitted the job\n  project  : Project account under which the job was run\n  endtime  : End time of the job (with -n/--node, this is '.')\n  runtime  : Runtime of the job (with -n/--node, this is '.')\n  flags    : Flags indicating various types of resource underutilizations\n  booked   : Number of booked cores (with -n/--node, this is '.')\n  maxmem   : Maximum memory used as reported by Slurm (if unavailable, this is '.')\n  cores    : Number of cores represented in the discovered jobstats files.\n  node     : Node(s) booked for the job, expanded into individual node names,\n             separated by commas; if no nodes were found, this is '.'.\n             The nodes for which jobstats files are available are listed first.\n  jobstats : jobstats files for the nodes, in the same order the nodes are\n             listed, separated by commas; if no jobstats files were discovered,\n             this is '.'\n\nIf -r/--running was used, an additional field is present:\n\n  timelimit_minutes : The time limit of the job in minutes\n\n\nFLAGS\n-----\n\nAn important part of jobstats output are usage flags.  These provide indications\nthat booked resources -- processor cores or memory -- might have been\nunderused.\n\nIn both plot and table output, flags are a comma-separated list of cautions\nregarding core and/or memory underutilisation.  The appearance of a flag does\nnot necessarily mean that resources were used incorrectly.  It depends upon the\ntools being used and the contents of the Slurm header, and also depends upon\nthe job profile.  Because usage information is gathered every 5 minutes, higher\ntransient usage of cores or memory may not be captured in the log files.\n\nFlags most likely to represent real overbooking of resources are\nnodes_overbooked, overbooked, !!half_overbooked, !!severely_overbooked, and\n!!swap_used.\n\nFor multinode jobs, flags other than nodes_overbooked are determined based only\non the usage of the first node.  Multinode jobs require careful analysis so as\nto not waste resources unnecessarily, and it is a common mistake among\nbeginning Uppmax users to book multiple nodes and run tools that cannot use\nmore than the first.  In this case, nodes_overbooked will appear.\n\nSome flags have a threshold below which they appear.  The default format is\ngenerally 'flag:value-booked:value-used'.\n\n  nodes_overbooked : nodes booked : nodes used\n      More nodes were booked than used\n  overbooked : % used (if &lt; 80%)\n      The maximum percentage of booked cores and/or memory that was used\n  !!half_overbooked\n      No more than 1/2 of both cores and memory of a node was used; consider booking\n      half a node instead.\n  !!severely_overbooked\n      No more than 1/4 of both cores and memory of a node was used, examine your job\n      requirements closely.\n  !!swap_used\n      Swap storage was used at any point within the job run\n  node_type_overbooked : type booked : type used\n      A fat node was requested that was larger than was needed.  This flag may be\n      produced spuriously if Slurm ran the job on a fat node when a fat node was not\n      requested by the user.\n  cores_overbooked : cores booked : cores used\n      More cores were booked than used (if &lt; 80%)\n  mem_overbooked : GB booked : GB used\n      More memory was available than was used (if &lt; 25% and more than one core).\n  core_mem_overbooked : GB in used cores : GB used\n      Less memory was used than was available in the cores that were used (if &lt; 50%).\n\nBy default no flags are indicated for jobs with memory-only cautions except for\nswap usage, because it is common for jobs to heavily use processor cores\nwithout using a sizable fraction of memory.  Use the -m/--memory option to\ninclude flags for memory underutilisation when those would be the only flags\nproduced.\n\nMore verbose flags are output with the -v/--verbose option.\n\n\nScript:   /sw/uppmax/bin/jobstats\nVersion:  2023-11-16\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"software/jobstats/#modes-of-jobstats-discovery","title":"Modes of <code>jobstats</code> discovery","text":"<p>There are five modes for discovery, depending on what the user provides on the command line:</p> <ul> <li>(1) discovery by job number for a completed job;</li> <li>(2) discovery by job number for a currently running job;</li> <li>(3) discovery by node and job number, for a completed or running job;</li> <li>(4) discovery by project</li> <li>(5) discovery via information provided on stdin.</li> </ul> <p>In the example command lines below, the -p/--plot option requests that plots of job resource usage are created.</p>"},{"location":"software/jobstats/#jobstats-discovery-mode-1-discovery-by-job-number-for-a-completed-job","title":"<code>jobstats</code> discovery mode 1: discovery by job number for a completed job","text":"<p>Discovery by job number for a completed job:</p> <pre><code>jobstats --plot jobid1 jobid2 jobid3\n</code></pre> <p>The job numbers valid on the cluster. finishedjobinfo is used to determine further information for each job.

the main software. Installing a new software version does not break existing installations, so many configurations can coexist on the same system.</p> <p>It offers a simple spec syntax so that users can specify versions and configuration options concisely. Spack is also simple for package authors: package files are written in pure Python, and specs allow package authors to maintain a single file for many different builds of the same package.</p> <p>Spack documentation</p> <p>The UPPMAX staff has already other ways to install most software applications. Please use Spack only if other ways to install your tool is not possible or very difficult, e.g. requiring very many dependencies and it is not available through, e.g. EasyBuild (that the staff can manage centrally). One or the reasons is that SPACK produces very many small files and that having two parallel build systems centrally may make things a little complex.</p> <p>This guide may change with time.
